If prospective properties are still too numerous to analyze, then the real estate data from Redfin or other real estate data will be merged with the Foursquare data. The merging of this data will greatly facilitate finding the most suitable properties overall.\n\n### The final results should a list of one to five prospective properties that my friend can later visit and make a final purchasing decision.\n",
