IBM Data Science Professional Certification Program through Coursera.

The files in this portfolio show what new skills I learned throughout this program.

In this Professional Certificate learners developed and honed
hands-on skills in Data Science and Machine Learning. Learners
started with an orientation of Data Science and its Methodology,
became familiar and used a variety of data science tools, learned
Python and SQL, performed Data Visualization and Analysis, and
created Machine Learning models. In the process they completed
several labs and assignments on the cloud including a Capstone
Project at the end to apply and demonstrate their knowledge and
skills.
